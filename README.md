# Phone Book Python v1
 This program is a simple digital phone book that can save/pull contacts from a text file, 
 as well as create a caller queue to keep track of important scheaduled phone calls.

 The "contact_list.txt" format should be as follows:
    {Name(First Last)},{PhoneNumber(XXX-XXX-XXXX)},{Date(YEAR-MM-DD)} 
    with each line indicated the end of a contact

    ex.
    John Doe,123-456-7890,2024-04-09
    Jane Smith,987-654-3210,2024-04-09

the "caller_queue.txt" format should be as follows:
    {Name(First Last)}
    with each line indicated the end of a contact

    ex.
    John Doe
    Jane Smith

The examples listed above are current placeholders that can be removed via the text
files or through the prompt system while running the program, and the files will
be preloaded upon running the program.
